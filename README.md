Houses
======

This is a simple app being developed with HTML boilerplate.
The objective is to show highschool students some application of Computer Science concepts in real life problems.
The suggested problem consists of connecting the three services (phone line, electricity and water supply) to all three houses.
However, the lines must not overlap.
This is an example of the K3-3 graph, which is not planar and, therefore, the problem is impossible to be solved in two dimensions.
